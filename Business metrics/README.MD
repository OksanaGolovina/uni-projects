In this research we use on-line store logs with visits and orders, and information on marketing costs. 
The main purpose of the research is to find ineffective and too expensive sources and make up recomendations to colleagues from marketing department.
We calculate product and marketing metrics, including DAU/WAU/MAU, sticky factor, LTV, CAC, ROMI and others.
In some cases cohort analysis is used.
