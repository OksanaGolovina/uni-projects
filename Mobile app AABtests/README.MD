We would like to make sure that changing fonts in our mobile application won't affect conversion to purchase. So we design and execute A/A/B experiments and look for statistically significant differences between test and control groups.
If you want to explore the purchase funnel and see the test results with your own eyes - welcome to mobile_app_AAB_tests research!
