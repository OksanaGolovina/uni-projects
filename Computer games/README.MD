The basis for this research is open data on global sales of computer games since 1980 to 2016. 
We explore the industry itself, popular platforms and genres, medium platform life expectancy, avarage critic scores and user ratings.
We draw up a customer portrait for each global region (America, Euriope and Asia) with emphasis on favorite platforms, genres, and content.
Two hypotheses are tested via t-test, Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests are also used in the research.
